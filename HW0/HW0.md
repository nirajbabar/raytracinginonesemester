This first assignment will have you investigate images from the history of rendering, as well as playing around with mesh files, while acclimating you to Github which we will utilize throughout the course. 

1) Find a representative image from the history of graphics rendering that you like. To help you find images, you can search the Siggraph History Archives (https://history.siggraph.org/technical-papers-view-all-entries/ Links to an external site.), or the ACM Digital Library (https://dl.acm.org/ Links to an external site.) and search for graphics keywords (i.e. motion blur, rainbows, cloud simulations, sand, etc). Once you pick an image, read a bit about the history of this rendering technique, and write a paragraph describing why you picked this image, what was groundbreaking or novel about the technology underlying this image. 

2) Create a PPT deck (1-2 slides) with the image as well as your description. 

3) Download a mesh file for an object of your choice. Using Meshlab (https://www.meshlab.net/ Links to an external site.), visualize the mesh from different angles and capture screenshots or output renders from the software. Add these images to your ppt deck. 

4) Complete this Github tutorial (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world Links to an external site.) if you are unfamiliar with using Github. 

5) When your slide deck is finished, create a pull request for your PPT deck into the proper HW0 folder. This will be merged into the HW0 folder so that you can present it for the class on Tuesday Jan 20th.
